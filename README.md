### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on all things CS, I'm a complete novice pretty much but I'm taking classes and studying various areas of CS in order to decide what I want to focus on as a career.
<br>
<br>
I'm currently primarily focused on learning HTML, CSS, JS (web fundamentals). I am also spending time learning and engaging in: programming basics, HackTheBox, Windows/Server, Azure, VM's
<br>
<br>
I'm looking to get my feet wet or collaborate on anything that will help grow my understanding and network in the CS world
<br>
